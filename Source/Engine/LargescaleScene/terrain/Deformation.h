 * A deformation of space. Such a deformation maps a 3D source point to a 3D

 * the destination space is called the <i>deformed</i> space. Source and
 * destination points are defined with their x,y,z coordinates in an orthonormal
 * reference frame. A Deformation is also responsible to set the shader uniforms
 * that are necessary to project a TerrainQuad on screen, taking the deformation
 * into account. The default implementation of this class implements the
 * identity deformation, i.e. the deformed point is equal to the local one.
