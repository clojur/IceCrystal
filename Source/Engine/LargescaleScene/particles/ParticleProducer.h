/**
 * An abstract %producer of %particles. A ParticleProducer uses an associated
 * ParticleStorage to store its %particles. <i>This storage must not be shared
 * with other ParticleProducer instances</i>. The main methods of a particle
 * producer are #moveParticles(), #removeOldParticles() and #addNewParticles().
 * Their name indicates their role quite clearly. A particle producer can have
 * layers, each layer needing its own fields per particle, and providing its
 * own #moveParticles(), #removeOldParticles() and  #addNewParticles() methods
 * using these layer specific fields (and possibly the fields provided by other
 * layers). A producer with layers allocates %particles with a size that is
 * sufficient to store the fields of all its layers (plus its own fields). It
 * also calls the three above methods of each layer.
 * The %particles can be stored on CPU or on GPU. In the GPU case some data may
 * be replicated on the CPU, like the %particles birth date, in order to know on
 * CPU when to remove old particles and when to create new ones (this storage
 * management can only be done on CPU). In the CPU case the %particles data can
 * also be copied on GPU if necessary (see #copyToTexture()).
