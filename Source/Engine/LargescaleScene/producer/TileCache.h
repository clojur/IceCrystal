/**
 * A cache of tiles to avoid recomputing recently produced tiles. A tile cache
 * keeps track of which tiles (identified by their level,tx,ty coordinates) are
 * currently stored in an associated TileStorage. It also keeps track of which
 * tiles are in use, and which are not. Unused tiles are kept in the TileStorage
 * as long as possible, in order to avoid re creating them if they become needed
 * again. But the storage associated with unused tiles can be reused to store
 * other tiles at any moment (in this case we say that a tile is evicted from
 * the cache of unused tiles).
 * Conversely, the storage associated with tiles currently in use cannot be
 * reaffected until these tiles become unused. A tile is in use when it is
 * returned by #getTile, and becomes unused when #putTile is called (more
 * precisely when the number of users of this tile becomes 0, this number being
 * incremented and decremented by #getTile and #putTile, respectively). The
 * tiles that are needed to render the current frame should be declared in use,
 * so that they are not evicted between their creation and their actual
 * rendering.
