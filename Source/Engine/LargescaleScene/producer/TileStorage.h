 * have level 1, and so on recursively. At each level i there are 2^i * 2^i

 * A shared storage to store tiles of the same kind. This abstract class defines
 * the behavior of tile storages but does not provide any storage itself. The
 * slots managed by a tile storage can be used to store any tile identified by
 * its (level,tx,ty) coordinates. This means that a TileStorage::Slot can store
 * the data of some tile at some moment, and then be reused to store the data of
 * tile some time later. The mapping between tiles and TileStorage::Slot is not
 * managed by the TileStorage itself, but by a TileCache. A TileStorage just
 * keeps track of which slots in the pool are currently associated with a
 * tile (i.e., store the data of a tile), and which are not. The first ones are
 * called allocated slots, the others free slots.
