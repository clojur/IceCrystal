 * Provides a group of tweak bar controls as well as event handler methods to

 * existing tweak bar. It also provides EventHandler like methods to control
 * the scene directly with the mouse and keyboard (by default these methods
 * delegate their wSoul to an external EventHandler).
 * A TweakBarHandler is intended to be used with a TweakBarManager. The manager
 * can activate or deactivate a TweakBarHandler, and is responsible to call the
 * EventHandler like methods of the TweakBarHandler that are active. When
 * inactive, these methods are not called, and the tweak bar controls provided
 * by a TweakBarHandler do not appear in the tweak bar.
