 * A CurveData that contains the elevation profile of a curve. It can produce
 * monotonic (i.e. only increasing or only decreasing) profiles, or
 * unconstrained profiles (both increasing and decreasing). Monotonic profiles
 * are useful for %rivers, which can never flow uphill. An elevation profile is
 * created by taking %terrain height samples regularly spaced along the curve,
 * by making them monotonic if desired, and by smoothing the resulting samples.
 * For large curve widths the distance between samples is larger, the
 * quadtree level used to get their altitude is lower, and the smoothing is
 * more aggressive, than for narrower curves. This gives smoother elevation
 * profiles for wider curves (a highway has less "bumps" than a small road).
